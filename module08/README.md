## Summary

[Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake) is a task automation tool, similar to
make. Tasks are defined in files named `Rakefile` or `*.rake` and contain
standard Ruby syntax. Tasks are very similar to methods however they use the
keyword `task` instead of `def`.

Rake files are often used to automate software building tasks including
cleaning up temporary files, executing automated tests and publishing results!


## Exercises

This module contains a spec which needs to pass. Your task is to satisfy the
requirements by implementing an appropriate rake file.
